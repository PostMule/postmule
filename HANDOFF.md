## Next
> Check `gh issue list --repo PostMule/app` for current state before starting.
> Do not suggest or offer to work on blocked or deferred issues — only note they exist.

**Blocked/Deferred (do not action):**
- #30 — End-to-end validation (BLOCKED — requires live credentials for Gmail, VPM, Gemini, Drive)

**Backlog empty** — all issues closed. Check `gh issue list --repo PostMule/app` for any new issues before starting.

**Pending (not a code task):** Push a `v*` tag (e.g. `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`) to trigger the first release. After that, update README Option A to link to the Releases page instead of "coming soon".
